# 🚀 Number System Converter & Calculator

---

> **Convert and Calculate with Elegance**  
> A sleek console program that converts numbers across **Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal** bases — and performs basic arithmetic on binary and octal numbers.

---

## ✨ Features

⋆ **Base Conversion:**  
  Convert any number between binary (2), octal (8), decimal (10), and hexadecimal (16).

⋆ **Simple Calculator:**  
  Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo on binary or octal numbers.

⋆ **Robust Input Validation:**  
  Ensures only valid numbers and operators are accepted.

⋆ **Negative Number Support:**  
  Handles negative inputs gracefully during conversion and calculation.

⋆ **Clear, User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Simple menus with helpful prompts and error messages.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input Parsing:**  
   The program verifies if the entered number matches its base format.

2. **Base Conversion:**  
   Converts numbers from any base to decimal (base 10) internally.

3. **Arithmetic Operations:**  
   For binary and octal modes, calculations are done on decimal equivalents, then results convert back to the original base.

4. **Display:**  
   Shows results neatly in all relevant bases or the selected base for calculations.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Run the program.  
2. Select your mode:  
   - `1` for number conversion  
   - `2` for basic arithmetic operations on binary/octals  
   - `3` to exit  
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter bases, numbers, and operations.
